Example REST Web Service to use as a data source for the
JBoss Enterprise Data Services Platform (EDS)

Revision History
================
1 - Blaine Mincey(blaine.mincey@redhat.com)  - Initial version.



Overview
========
Simple JAX-RS/RESTEasy web service that exposes a GET 
operation that reads in an XML file.  The purpose of
this is to simply return a large (over 100 records) 
dataset that can ultimately be used as a data source
for a virtual data abstraction layer in EDS.


System Requirements
===================
- Maven 2.x or higher
- JDK 1.5.x or higher


Building the project
====================
mvn clean war:war

Creates --> target/CustomerRESTWebSvc.war

This Maven command will 'clean' the workspace and then
compile/build the WAR file that can be deployed to the
EDS-P or a JBoss Application Server instance.  The WAR
file will be in the 'target' directory.

The WAR file can be deployed 'as-is' to a JBoss 5.x
application server.  No other servers were tested
for this example.

Running the project and manually testing it
===========================================
The WAR file should be copied to the JBoss 'deploy'
directory in order to be deployed to the application
server instance.
